# SIMI-FORMULAR
This Python program allows the user to choose and solve one of five physics formulas. 
When the program runs, it displays a menu of formulas. The user selects a formula,
and the program asks for the required values. After the user enters the values,
the program calculates and displays the result. The process repeats until the user chooses to exit.

The five formulas included are:

Speed = distance ÷ time

Force = mass × acceleration

Pressure = force ÷ area

Ohm’s Law: Voltage = current × resistance

Kinetic Energy = ½ × mass × velocity²
